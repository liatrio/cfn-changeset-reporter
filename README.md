# cfn-changeset-reporter

A GitHub Action to generate color-coded reports directly in GitHub Actions logs from AWS CloudFormation changesets with focus on resource replacement impact.

## Features

- Generates detailed reports about CloudFormation changesets
- Color-codes resources by their impact (游릭 Add, 游리 Modify, 游댮 Replacement)
- Groups resources by replacement status for better visibility
- Highlights which property changes cause resource replacements
- Outputs directly to GitHub Actions console with rich formatting
- Can use the latest changeset or a specified one
- Provides outputs that can be used by subsequent workflow steps
- Dynamic table formatting that automatically adjusts column widths based on content

## Usage

          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,

### Resource Grouping and Color Coding

Resources are grouped and color-coded by their impact:

- 游댮 **Resources requiring replacement** - Highest impact changes that will create new resources
- 游리 **Resources modified in-place** - Medium impact changes that modify existing resources
- 游릭 **New resources** - Resources being added for the first time

### Replacement Detail Analysis

For resources that require replacement:

- Identifies and highlights the specific property changes causing the replacement
- Marks properties with `丘멆잺` when they trigger resource recreation
- Shows whether replacement is conditional or always required

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+

### Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The built action will be in the `dist` folder.
